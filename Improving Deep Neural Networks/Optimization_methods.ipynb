    "Because mini-batch gradient descent makes a parameter update after seeing just a subset of examples, the direction of the update has some variance, and so the path taken by mini-batch gradient descent will \"oscillate\" toward convergence. Using momentum can reduce these oscillations. \n",

    "Momentum takes into account the past gradients to smooth out the update. We will store the 'direction' of the previous gradients in the variable $v$. Formally, this will be the exponentially weighted average of the gradient on previous steps. You can also think of $v$ as the \"velocity\" of a ball rolling downhill, building up speed (and momentum) according to the direction of the gradient/slope of the hill. \n",

    "Momentum usually helps, but given the small learning rate and the simplistic dataset, its impact is almost negligeable. Also, the huge oscillations you see in the cost come from the fact that some minibatches are more difficult thans others for the optimization algorithm.\n",
